They need to keep a complete, accurate record of their work, including the conditions under which the experiment was carried out, the procedures they followed, and the results they obtained.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Technical skills.</em></strong> Biological technicians need to set up and operate sophisticated equipment and instruments. They also may need to adjust equipment to ensure that experiments are conducted properly.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Other Experience</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Prospective biological technicians should have laboratory experience. In addition to coursework, students may gain laboratory experience during summer internships with prospective employers, such as pharmaceutical and medicine manufacturers, or in university laboratories.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Advancement</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Biological technicians may advance to scientist positions, such as <a href=\"/ooh/life-physical-and-social-science/microbiologists.htm\"><u>microbiologist</u></a>, after a few years of experience working as a technician or after earning a master’s degree or Ph.D. Gaining more experience and higher levels of education often allows biological technicians to move into positions such as <a href=\"/ooh/management/natural-sciences-managers.htm\">natural sciences managers</a> or <a href=\"/ooh/education-training-and-library/postsecondary-teachers.htm\"><u>postsecondary teachers</u></a>.</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"], "25-1053": ["Title": "Postsecondary Teachers", "Description": "Postsecondary teachers instruct students in a wide variety of academic and career and technical subjects beyond the high school level. They also conduct research and publish scholarly papers and books.", "How to Become One": "\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n<p>Educational requirements vary with the subject taught and the type of educational institution. Most commonly, postsecondary teachers must have a Ph.D. However, a master\'s degree may be enough for some postsecondary teachers at community colleges. In career and technical schools, work experience may be important for getting a postsecondary teaching job.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Education</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Postsecondary teachers who work for 4-year colleges and universities typically need a doctoral degree in their field. Some schools may hire those with a master’s degree or those who are doctoral degree candidates for some specialties, such as fine arts, or for some part-time positions.</p>\n\n<p>Doctoral programs generally take multiple years after the completion of a bachelor’s degree program. They spend time completing a master’s degree and then writing a doctoral dissertation, which is a paper presenting original research in the student’s field of study. Candidates usually specialize in a subfield, such as organic chemistry or European history.</p>\n\n<p>Community colleges or career and technical schools also may hire those with a master’s degree. However, in some fields, there are more applicants than available positions. In these situations, institutions can be more selective, and they frequently choose applicants who have a Ph.D. over those with a master’s degree.</p>\n\n<p>Postsecondary teachers who teach career and technical education courses, such as culinary arts or cosmetology, may not be required to have graduate-level education. At a minimum they must hold the degree of the program in which they are teaching. For example, the teacher must hold an associate’s degree if they teach a program that is at the associate’s degree level. In addition, work experience or certification may be just as important as education for getting a postsecondary teaching job at a career or technical school.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Other Experience</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Some institutions may prefer to hire those with teaching or other work experience, but this is not a requirement for all fields or for all employers.</p>\n\n<p>In health specialties, art, or education fields, hands-on work experience in the industry can be important. Postsecondary teachers in these fields often gain experience by working in an occupation related to their field of expertise.</p>\n\n<p>In fields such as biological science, physics, and chemistry, some postsecondary teachers have postdoctoral research experience. These short-term jobs, sometimes called “post-docs,” usually involve working for 2 to 3 years as a research associate or in a similar position, often at a college or university.</p>\n\n<p>Some postsecondary teachers gain teaching experience by working as graduate teaching assistants—students who are enrolled in a graduate program and teach classes in the institution in which they are enrolled.</p>\n\n<p>Some postsecondary teachers, especially adjunct professors, have another job in addition to teaching.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Licenses, Certifications, and Registrations</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Postsecondary teachers who prepare students for an occupation that requires a license, certification, or registration, may need to have—or they may benefit from having—the same credential. For example, a postsecondary nursing teacher might need a nursing license or a postsecondary education teacher might need a teaching license.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Advancement</strong></h3>\n\n<p>A major goal for postsecondary teachers with a doctoral degree is attaining a tenure—a guarantee that a professor cannot be fired without just cause. It can take up to 7 years of moving up the ranks in tenure-track positions. The ranks are assistant professor, associate professor, and professor. Tenure is granted through a review of the candidate’s research, contribution to the institution, and teaching.</p>\n\n<p>Tenure and tenure track positions are declining as institutions are relying more heavily on part-time faculty.</p>\n\n<p>Some tenured professors advance to administrative positions, such as dean or president.

Most appraisers of residential or commercial property must have at least a bachelor’s degree to obtain the entry-level state license category. Check with your state\'s licensing board for specific requirements for both assessors and appraisers.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Education</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Although requirements may vary by state, appraisers of residential or commercial property usually must have at least a bachelor’s degree.</p>\n\n<p>College courses in subjects such as economics, finance, mathematics, computer science, English, and business or real estate law can be useful for prospective appraisers and assessors.</p>\n\n<p>Most states set education and experience requirements that assessors must meet in order to practice. A few states have no statewide requirements; instead, each locality sets the standards. In some localities, candidates may qualify with a high school diploma.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Training</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Employers generally require candidates to take basic appraisal courses, complete long-term on-the-job training, and work enough hours to meet the requirements for licenses or certificates.&#160;</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Licenses, Certifications, and Registrations</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Federal law requires appraisers to have a state license or certification when working on federally related transactions, such as appraisals for loans made by federally insured banks and financial institutions. <a href=\"http://www.appraisalfoundation.org\" class=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">The Appraisal Foundation</a> (TAF) offers information on appraisal licensing. There is no such federal requirement for assessors, although some states require certification. For state specific requirements, applicants should contact their state board.</p>\n\n<p>Real property appraisers usually value one property at a time, while assessors value many at once, but both occupations use similar methods and techniques. As a result, assessors and appraisers tend to take the same courses for certification. In addition to passing a statewide examination, candidates must usually complete a set number of on-the-job hours.</p>\n\n<p>The credential level determines what type of property a person may appraise. The four federal appraiser classifications are as follows:</p>\n\n<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;•&#160;Licensed Trainee Real Property Appraiser</p>\n\n<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;•&#160;Licensed Residential Real Property Appraiser</p>\n\n<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;•&#160;Certified Residential Real Property Appraiser</p>\n\n<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;•&#160;Certified General Real Property Appraiser</p>\n\n<p>Many states offer a Licensed Trainee Real Property Appraiser credential to candidates working toward licensure or certification. Training programs vary by state, but they usually require candidates to take at least 75 hours of specified appraiser education before applying for a job as a trainee.</p>\n\n<p>Many states offer the Licensed Residential Real Property Appraiser. With this license, a qualified person may appraise noncomplex one-to-four unit residences with a value of less than $1 million and complex one-to-four unit residences with a value of less than $250,000. A candidate must have the following qualifications to get this certificate:</p>\n\n<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;• 30 semester hours of college-level education</p>\n\n<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;•&#160;150 hours of appraiser-qualifying education</p>\n\n<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;•&#160;2,000 hours of on-the-job training completed over at least 1 year</p>\n\n<p>Being a Certified Residential Real Property Appraiser is the minimum requirement to appraise a residential property with a loan amount over $250,000 or any other type of residential property even if the loan amount is less than $250,000. A candidate must have the following qualifications to get this certificate:</p>\n\n<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;•&#160;Bachelor’s degree</p>\n\n<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;•&#160;200 hours of appraiser-specific qualifying education</p>\n\n<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;• 2,500 hours of work experience completed over at least 2 years</p>\n\n<p>Being a Certified General Real Property Appraiser permits a person to appraise real property of any type and any value.

In states that mandate certification for assessors, the requirements are usually similar to those for appraisers. For example, the <a href=\"http://www.iaao.org/\" class=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">International Association of Assessing Officers</a> (IAAO) offers the Certified Assessment Evaluator (CAE). This designation covers topics that include property valuation for tax purposes, property tax administration, and property tax policy. Applicants are required to have a bachelor\'s degree prior to obtaining the designation.</p>\n\n<p>For those states that do not require certification for assessors, the hiring office usually requires the candidate to take basic appraisal courses, complete on-the-job training, and meet the work-hours requirements for appraisal licenses or certificates. Many assessors also have a state appraiser license or credential.</p>\n\n<p>Assessors tend to start working in an assessor\'s office that provides on-the-job training; smaller municipalities are often unable to provide this work experience. An alternate source of experience for aspiring assessors is through a revaluation firm.</p>\n\n<p>Both appraisers and assessors must take continuing education courses to keep the license or certification. Exact requirements vary by state and certification.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Important Qualities</strong></h3>\n\n<p><strong><em>Analytical skills</em>.</strong> Appraisers and assessors of real estate use many sources of data when valuing a property. As a result, they must carefully research and analyze all factors before estimating a value and producing a final written report.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Customer-service skills</em>.</strong> Because appraisers must regularly interact with clients, being polite and friendly is important. In addition, these characteristics may help expand future business opportunities.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Math skills.</em></strong> Accurately analyzing real estate data includes such steps as calculating square footage of land and building space, so workers must have good math skills.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Organizational skills</em>.</strong> To successfully accomplish all the tasks related to appraising and assessing a property, appraisers and assessors of real estate need good organizational skills.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Problem-solving skills</em>.</strong> Appraising or assessing a property\'s value may involve unexpected problems. The ability to develop and apply an alternative solution is crucial to successfully completing the appraisal and report on time.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Time-management skills</em>.</strong> Appraisers and assessors of real estate often work under time constraints, sometimes appraising many properties in a single day.

Some schools may hire those with a master’s degree or those who are doctoral degree candidates for some specialties, such as fine arts, or for some part-time positions.</p>\n\n<p>Doctoral programs generally take multiple years after the completion of a bachelor’s degree program.

Part of the training is spent on a driving course, where drivers practice various maneuvers with a bus. They then begin to drive in light traffic and eventually make practice runs on the type of route that they expect to drive. New drivers make regularly scheduled trips with passengers and are accompanied by an experienced driver who gives helpful tips, answers questions, and evaluates the new driver\'s performance.</p>\n\n<p>Some drivers’ training is also spent in the classroom. They learn their company’s rules and regulations, state and municipal traffic laws, and safe driving practices. Drivers also learn about schedules and bus routes, fares, and how to interact with passengers.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Licenses, Certifications, and Registrations</strong></h3>\n\n<p>All bus drivers must have a commercial driver’s license (CDL). Some new bus drivers can earn their CDL during on-the-job training. The qualifications for getting one vary by state but generally include passing both knowledge and driving tests. States have the right to not issue a license to someone who has had a CDL suspended by another state.</p>\n\n<p>Drivers can get endorsements to a CDL that reflect their ability to drive a special type of vehicle. All bus drivers must have a passenger (P) endorsement, and school bus drivers must also have a school bus (S) endorsement. Getting the P and S endorsements requires additional knowledge and driving tests administered by a certified examiner.</p>\n\n<p>Many states require all bus drivers to be 18 years of age or older and those who drive across state lines to be at least 21 years old.</p>\n\n<p>Federal regulations require interstate bus drivers to pass a physical exam and submit to random testing for drug or alcohol abuse while on duty. Most states impose similar regulations. Bus drivers can have their CDL suspended if they are convicted of a felony involving the use of a motor vehicle or of driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs.

It is not necessary for interpreters and translators to have been raised in two languages to succeed in these jobs, but many grew up communicating in the languages in which they use for work.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Education</strong></h3>\n\n<p>The educational backgrounds of interpreters and translators vary widely, but it is essential that they be fluent in English and at least one other language.</p>\n\n<p>High school students interested in becoming an interpreter or translator should take a broad range of courses that focus on English writing and comprehension, foreign languages, and computer proficiency. Other helpful pursuits for prospects include spending time in a foreign country, engaging in direct contact with foreign cultures, and reading extensively on a variety of subjects in English and at least one other language. Through community organizations, students interested in sign language interpreting may take introductory classes in American Sign Language (ASL) and seek out volunteer opportunities to work with people who are deaf or hard of hearing.</p>\n\n<p>Beyond high school, people interested in becoming interpreters or translators have numerous educational options. Although many jobs require a bachelor’s degree, majoring in a language is not always necessary. Rather, an educational background in a particular field of study can provide a natural area of subject-matter expertise.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Training</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Interpreters and translators generally need specialized training on how to do their work. Formal programs in interpreting and translating are available at colleges and universities nationwide and through nonuniversity training programs, conferences, and courses.</p>\n\n<p>Many people who work as interpreters or translators in more technical areas—such as software localization, engineering, or finance—have a master’s degree. Those working in the community as court or medical interpreters or translators are more likely to complete job-specific training programs or certificates.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Licenses, Certifications, and Registrations</strong></h3>\n\n<p>There is currently no universal certification required of interpreters and translators beyond passing the required court interpreting exams offered by most states. However, workers can take a variety of tests that show proficiency. For example, the <a href=\"https://www.atanet.org/\" class=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">American Translators Association</a> provides certification in 27 language combinations involving English.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ncsc.org/sitecore/content/microsites/fcice/home\" class=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Federal courts</a> provide judiciary certification for Spanish, Navajo, and Haitian Creole interpreters, and many states offer their own certifications or licenses for these languages.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://nad.org/\" class=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">National Association of the Deaf</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.rid.org/\" class=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf</a> jointly offer certification for general sign language interpreters.

Doing informal or volunteer work is an excellent way for people seeking interpreter or translator jobs to gain experience.</p>\n\n<p>Volunteer opportunities for interpreters are available through community organizations, hospitals, and sporting events, such as marathons, that involve international competitors.</p>\n\n<p>Paid or unpaid internships are other ways that interpreters and translators can gain experience. Escort interpreting may offer an opportunity for inexperienced candidates to work alongside a more experienced interpreter. Interpreters also may find it easier to begin working in industries with particularly high demand for language services, such as court or medical interpreting.</p>\n\n<p>Whatever path of entry new interpreters and translators pursue, they should develop mentoring relationships with experienced workers in the field to build their skills and confidence and to establish and expand a network of contacts. Mentoring may be formal, such as that received through a professional association, or informal, such as that engaged in with a coworker or an acquaintance who has experience as an interpreter or translator.

They can also manage or start their own business.</p>\n\n<p>Many self-employed interpreters and translators start their own business by first establishing themselves in their field. They may submit resumes and samples to different translation and interpreting companies and work for companies that match their skills with a job. Many then get work on the basis of their reputation or through referrals from existing clients.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Important Qualities</strong></h3>\n\n<p><strong><em>Business skills</em>.</strong> Self-employed and freelance interpreters and translators need general business skills to manage their finances and careers successfully. They must set prices for their work, bill customers, keep records, and market their services in order to build their client base.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Concentration</em>.</strong> Interpreters and translators must have the ability to concentrate while others are speaking or moving around them.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Cultural sensitivity</em>.</strong> Interpreters and translators must be sensitive to cultural differences and expectations among the people whom they are helping to communicate.

Apprentices learn about operating and maintaining equipment; using controls and balancing heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems; safety; electricity; and air quality. Employers may prefer to hire these workers because they usually require considerably less on-the-job training. However, because of the limited number of apprenticeship programs, employers often have difficulty finding workers who have completed one.&#160;</p>\n\n<p>Experienced stationary engineers and boiler operators update their skills regularly through training, especially when new equipment is introduced or when regulations change.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Licenses, Certifications, and Registrations</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Some state and local governments require licensure for stationary engineers and boiler operators. These governments typically have several classes of stationary engineer and boiler operator licenses. Each class specifies the type and size of equipment the engineer is permitted to operate without supervision. Many employers require stationary engineers and boiler operators to demonstrate competency through licenses or company-specific exams before they are allowed to operate the equipment without supervision.</p>\n\n<p>A top-level engineer or operator is qualified to run a large facility, supervise others, and operate equipment of all types and capacities. Engineers and operators with licenses below this level are limited in the types or capacities of equipment they may operate without supervision.</p>\n\n<p>Applicants for licensure usually must be at least 18 years of age, meet experience requirements, and pass a written exam. In some cases, employers may require that workers be licensed before starting the job. A stationary engineer or boiler operator who moves from one state or city to another may have to pass an examination for a new license because of regional differences in licensing requirements.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Advancement</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Generally, stationary engineers and boiler operators can advance as they become qualified to operate larger, more powerful, and more varied equipment by obtaining higher class licenses.

Most architects earn their professional degree through a 5-year Bachelor of Architecture degree program, intended for students with no previous architectural training. Many earn a master’s degree in architecture, which can take 1 to 5 years in addition to the time spent earning a bachelor’s degree. The amount of time required depends on the extent of the student’s previous education and training in architecture.</p>\n\n<p>A typical bachelor’s degree program includes courses in architectural history and theory, building design with an emphasis on computer-aided design and drafting (CADD), structures, construction methods, professional practices, math, physical sciences, and liberal arts. Central to most architectural programs is the design studio, where students apply the skills and concepts learned in the classroom to create drawings and three-dimensional models of their designs.</p>\n\n<p>Currently, 34 states require that architects hold a professional degree in architecture from one of the 123 schools of architecture accredited by the <a href=\"http://www.naab.org/architecture_programs/home\" class=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">National Architectural Accrediting Board</a> (NAAB).

Some states allow a portion of the training to occur in the offices of employers in related careers, such as engineers and general contractors. Architecture students who complete internships while still in school can count some of that time toward the 3-year training period.</p>\n\n<p>Interns in architectural firms may help design part of a project. They may help prepare architectural documents and drawings, build models, and prepare construction drawings on CADD. Interns may also research building codes and write specifications for building materials, installation criteria, the quality of finishes, and other related details. Licensed architects will take the documents that interns produce, make edits to them, finalize plans, and then sign and seal the documents.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Licenses, Certifications, and Registrations</strong></h3>\n\n<p>All states and the District of Columbia require architects to be licensed.

In career and technical schools, work experience may be important for getting a postsecondary teaching job.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Education</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Postsecondary teachers who work for 4-year colleges and universities typically need a doctoral degree in their field. Some schools may hire those with a master’s degree or those who are doctoral degree candidates for some specialties, such as fine arts, or for some part-time positions.</p>\n\n<p>Doctoral programs generally take multiple years after the completion of a bachelor’s degree program. They spend time completing a master’s degree and then writing a doctoral dissertation, which is a paper presenting original research in the student’s field of study. Candidates usually specialize in a subfield, such as organic chemistry or European history.</p>\n\n<p>Community colleges or career and technical schools also may hire those with a master’s degree. However, in some fields, there are more applicants than available positions. In these situations, institutions can be more selective, and they frequently choose applicants who have a Ph.D. over those with a master’s degree.</p>\n\n<p>Postsecondary teachers who teach career and technical education courses, such as culinary arts or cosmetology, may not be required to have graduate-level education. At a minimum they must hold the degree of the program in which they are teaching. For example, the teacher must hold an associate’s degree if they teach a program that is at the associate’s degree level. In addition, work experience or certification may be just as important as education for getting a postsecondary teaching job at a career or technical school.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Other Experience</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Some institutions may prefer to hire those with teaching or other work experience, but this is not a requirement for all fields or for all employers.</p>\n\n<p>In health specialties, art, or education fields, hands-on work experience in the industry can be important. Postsecondary teachers in these fields often gain experience by working in an occupation related to their field of expertise.</p>\n\n<p>In fields such as biological science, physics, and chemistry, some postsecondary teachers have postdoctoral research experience. These short-term jobs, sometimes called “post-docs,” usually involve working for 2 to 3 years as a research associate or in a similar position, often at a college or university.</p>\n\n<p>Some postsecondary teachers gain teaching experience by working as graduate teaching assistants—students who are enrolled in a graduate program and teach classes in the institution in which they are enrolled.</p>\n\n<p>Some postsecondary teachers, especially adjunct professors, have another job in addition to teaching.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Licenses, Certifications, and Registrations</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Postsecondary teachers who prepare students for an occupation that requires a license, certification, or registration, may need to have—or they may benefit from having—the same credential. For example, a postsecondary nursing teacher might need a nursing license or a postsecondary education teacher might need a teaching license.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Advancement</strong></h3>\n\n<p>A major goal for postsecondary teachers with a doctoral degree is attaining a tenure—a guarantee that a professor cannot be fired without just cause. It can take up to 7 years of moving up the ranks in tenure-track positions. The ranks are assistant professor, associate professor, and professor. Tenure is granted through a review of the candidate’s research, contribution to the institution, and teaching.</p>\n\n<p>Tenure and tenure track positions are declining as institutions are relying more heavily on part-time faculty.</p>\n\n<p>Some tenured professors advance to administrative positions, such as dean or president.

However, many industrial engineers have degrees in mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, manufacturing engineering, industrial engineering technology, or general engineering. Students interested in studying industrial engineering should take high school courses in mathematics, such as algebra, trigonometry, and calculus; computer science; and sciences such as chemistry and physics.</p>\n\n<p>Bachelor’s degree programs include lectures in classrooms and practice in laboratories. Courses include statistics, production systems planning, and manufacturing systems design, among others.

A graduate degree allows an engineer to work as a professor at a college or university or to engage in research and development. Some 5-year or even 6-year cooperative education plans combine classroom study with practical work, permitting students to gain experience and to finance part of their education.</p>\n\n<p>Programs in industrial engineering are accredited by <a href=\"http://www.abet.org/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">ABET</a>.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Important Qualities</strong></h3>\n\n<p><strong><em>Creativity.</em></strong> Industrial engineers use creativity and ingenuity to design new production processes in many kinds of settings in order to reduce the use of material resources, time, or labor while accomplishing the same goal.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Critical-thinking skills.</em></strong> Industrial engineers create new systems to solve problems related to waste and inefficiency. Solving these problems requires logic and reasoning to identify strengths and weaknesses of alternative solutions, conclusions, or approaches to the problems.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Listening skills.</em></strong> These engineers often operate in teams, but they also must solicit feedback from customers, vendors, and production staff. They must listen to customers and clients in order to fully grasp ideas and problems the first time.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Math skills.</em></strong> Industrial engineers use the principles of calculus, trigonometry, and other advanced topics in mathematics for analysis, design, and troubleshooting in their work.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Problem-solving skills.</em></strong> In designing facilities for manufacturing and processes for providing services, these engineers deal with several issues at once, from workers’ safety to quality assurance.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Speaking skills.</em></strong> Industrial engineers sometimes have to explain their instructions to production staff or technicians before they can make written instructions available. Being able to explain concepts clearly and quickly is crucial to preventing costly mistakes and loss of time.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Writing skills.</em></strong> Industrial engineers must prepare documentation for other engineers or scientists, or for future reference. The documentation must be coherent and explain their thinking clearly so that the others can understand the information.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Licenses, Certifications, and Registrations</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Licensure is not required for entry-level positions as an industrial engineer. A Professional Engineering (PE) license, which allows for higher levels of leadership and independence, can be acquired later in one’s career. Licensed engineers are called professional engineers (PEs). A PE can oversee the work of other engineers, sign off on projects, and provide services directly to the public. State licensure generally requires</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A degree from an ABET-accredited engineering program</li>\n\n<li>A passing score on the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) exam</li>\n\n<li>Relevant work experience, typically at least 4 years</li>\n\n<li>A passing score on the Professional Engineering (PE) exam</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The initial FE exam can be taken after one earns a bachelor’s degree. Engineers who pass this exam are commonly called engineers in training (EITs) or engineer interns (EIs). After meeting work experience requirements, EITs and EIs can take the second exam, called the Principles and Practice of Engineering.</p>\n\n<p>Several states require engineers to take continuing education in order to keep their licenses. Most states recognize licenses from other states, as long as the other state’s licensing requirements meet or exceed their own licensing requirements.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Advancement</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Beginning industrial engineers usually work under the supervision of experienced engineers. In large companies, new engineers also may receive formal training in classes or seminars. As beginning engineers gain knowledge and experience, they move on to more difficult projects with greater independence to develop designs, solve problems, and make decisions.</p>\n\n<p>Eventually, industrial engineers may advance to become technical specialists, such as quality engineers or facility planners. In that role, they supervise a team of engineers and technicians. Obtaining a master’s degree facilitates such specialization and thus advancement.</p>\n\n<p>Many industrial engineers move into management positions because the work they do is closely related to the work of managers.

Postsecondary teachers in these fields often gain experience by working in an occupation related to their field of expertise.</p>\n\n<p>In fields such as biological science, physics, and chemistry, some postsecondary teachers have postdoctoral research experience. These short-term jobs, sometimes called “post-docs,” usually involve working for 2 to 3 years as a research associate or in a similar position, often at a college or university.</p>\n\n<p>Some postsecondary teachers gain teaching experience by working as graduate teaching assistants—students who are enrolled in a graduate program and teach classes in the institution in which they are enrolled.</p>\n\n<p>Some postsecondary teachers, especially adjunct professors, have another job in addition to teaching.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Licenses, Certifications, and Registrations</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Postsecondary teachers who prepare students for an occupation that requires a license, certification, or registration, may need to have—or they may benefit from having—the same credential. For example, a postsecondary nursing teacher might need a nursing license or a postsecondary education teacher might need a teaching license.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Advancement</strong></h3>\n\n<p>A major goal for postsecondary teachers with a doctoral degree is attaining a tenure—a guarantee that a professor cannot be fired without just cause. It can take up to 7 years of moving up the ranks in tenure-track positions. The ranks are assistant professor, associate professor, and professor. Tenure is granted through a review of the candidate’s research, contribution to the institution, and teaching.</p>\n\n<p>Tenure and tenure track positions are declining as institutions are relying more heavily on part-time faculty.</p>\n\n<p>Some tenured professors advance to administrative positions, such as dean or president.

Many employers will often pay the costs associated with the CPA exam.</p>\n\n<p>CPAs are licensed by their state’s Board of Accountancy. Becoming a CPA requires passing a national exam and meeting other state requirements. Almost all states require CPA candidates to complete 150 semester hours of college coursework to be certified, which is 30 hours more than the usual 4-year bachelor’s degree. Many schools offer a 5-year combined bachelor’s and master’s degree to meet the 150-hour requirement, but a master’s degree is not required.</p>\n\n<p>A few states allow a number of years of public accounting experience to substitute for a college degree.</p>\n\n<p>All states use the four-part Uniform CPA Examination from the <a href=\"http://www.aicpa.org/\" class=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">American Institute of Certified Public Accountants</a> (AICPA).

Those who excel may become supervisors, managers, or partners; open their own public accounting firm; or transfer to executive positions in management accounting or internal auditing in private firms.</p>\n\n<p>Management accountants often start as cost accountants, junior internal auditors, or trainees for other accounting positions. As they rise through the organization, they may advance to accounting manager, chief cost accountant, budget director, or manager of internal auditing. Some become controllers, treasurers, financial vice presidents, chief financial officers, or corporation presidents.</p>\n\n<p>Public accountants, management accountants, and internal auditors can move from one aspect of accounting and auditing to another.

In addition, work experience or certification may be just as important as education for getting a postsecondary teaching job at a career or technical school.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Other Experience</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Some institutions may prefer to hire those with teaching or other work experience, but this is not a requirement for all fields or for all employers.</p>\n\n<p>In health specialties, art, or education fields, hands-on work experience in the industry can be important. Postsecondary teachers in these fields often gain experience by working in an occupation related to their field of expertise.</p>\n\n<p>In fields such as biological science, physics, and chemistry, some postsecondary teachers have postdoctoral research experience. These short-term jobs, sometimes called “post-docs,” usually involve working for 2 to 3 years as a research associate or in a similar position, often at a college or university.</p>\n\n<p>Some postsecondary teachers gain teaching experience by working as graduate teaching assistants—students who are enrolled in a graduate program and teach classes in the institution in which they are enrolled.</p>\n\n<p>Some postsecondary teachers, especially adjunct professors, have another job in addition to teaching.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Licenses, Certifications, and Registrations</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Postsecondary teachers who prepare students for an occupation that requires a license, certification, or registration, may need to have—or they may benefit from having—the same credential. For example, a postsecondary nursing teacher might need a nursing license or a postsecondary education teacher might need a teaching license.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Advancement</strong></h3>\n\n<p>A major goal for postsecondary teachers with a doctoral degree is attaining a tenure—a guarantee that a professor cannot be fired without just cause. It can take up to 7 years of moving up the ranks in tenure-track positions. The ranks are assistant professor, associate professor, and professor. Tenure is granted through a review of the candidate’s research, contribution to the institution, and teaching.</p>\n\n<p>Tenure and tenure track positions are declining as institutions are relying more heavily on part-time faculty.</p>\n\n<p>Some tenured professors advance to administrative positions, such as dean or president.

The first stage of the license is known as the 3rd Assistant Engineer’s License. With experience and further testing, a marine engineer may get a 2nd and then a 1st Assistant Engineer’s License. The highest level of licensure is known as Chief Engineer. Higher grades of licensing usually are accompanied by higher pay and more responsibilities.</p>\n\n<p>Licensure is not required for entry-level positions as an engineer. A Professional Engineering (PE) license, which allows for higher levels of leadership and independence, can be acquired later in one’s career. Licensed engineers are called professional engineers (PEs). A PE can oversee the work of other engineers, sign off on projects, and provide services directly to the public. State licensure generally requires all of the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A degree from an ABET-accredited engineering program</li>\n\n<li>A passing score on the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) exam</li>\n\n<li>Relevant work experience, typically at least 4 years</li>\n\n<li>A passing score on the Professional Engineering (PE) exam</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The initial FE exam can be taken after one earns a bachelor’s degree.

Each state’s board of nursing can provide details.</p>\n\n<p>The <em>Consensus Model for APRN Regulation</em>, a document developed by a wide variety of professional nursing organizations, including the <a href=\"https://www.ncsbn.org/index.htm\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">National Council of State Boards of Nursing</a>, aims to standardize APRN requirements. The model recommends all APRNs to complete a graduate degree from an accredited program; be a licensed registered nurse; pass a national certification exam; and earn a second license specific to one of the APRN roles and to a certain group of patients.</p>\n\n<p>Certification is required in the vast majority of states to use an APRN title. Certification is used to show proficiency in an APRN role and is often a requirement for state licensure.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.nbcrna.com/Pages/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">National Board of&#160;Certification and Recertification&#160;for Nurse Anesthetists</a> (NBCRNA) offers the National Certification Examination (NCE).

Individuals with this designation must recertify every 5 years.</p>\n\n<p>There are a number of certification exams for nurse practitioners because of the large number of populations NPs may work with and the number of specialty areas in which they may practice. Certifications are available from a number of professional organizations, including the <a href=\"http://www.nursecredentialing.org/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">American Nurses Credentialing Center</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.pncb.org/ptistore/control/index\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Pediatric Nursing Certification Board</a>.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Important Qualities</strong></h3>\n\n<p><strong><em>Communication skills.</em></strong> Advanced practice registered nurses must be able to communicate with patients and other healthcare professionals to ensure that the appropriate course of action is understood.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Critical-thinking skills.</em></strong> APRNs must be able to assess changes in a patient’s health, quickly determine the most appropriate course of action, and decide if a consultation with another healthcare professional is needed.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Compassion.</em></strong> Nurses should be caring and sympathetic when treating patients who are in pain or who are experiencing emotional distress.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Detail oriented.</em></strong> APRNs must be responsible and detail- oriented because they provide various treatments and medications that affect the health of their patients. During an evaluation, they must pick up on even the smallest changes in a patient’s condition.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Interpersonal skills.</em></strong> Advanced practice registered nurses must work with patients and families as well as with other healthcare providers and staff within the organizations where they provide care. They should work as part of a team to determine and execute the best possible healthcare options for the patients they treat.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Leadership skills.</em></strong> Advanced practice registered nurses often work in positions of seniority. They must effectively lead and sometimes manage other nurses on staff when providing patient care.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Resourcefulness.</em></strong> APRNs must know where to find the answers that they need in a timely fashion.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Advancement</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Because the APRN designation is in itself an advancement of one’s career, many APRNs choose to remain in this role for the duration of their career. Some APRNs may take on managerial or administrative roles, while others go into academia. APRNs who earn a doctoral degree may conduct independent research or work in an interprofessional research team.</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"], "25-2032": ["Title": "Career and Technical Education Teachers", "Description": "Career and technical education teachers instruct students in various technical and vocational subjects, such as auto repair, healthcare, and culinary arts.

For example, a postsecondary nursing teacher might need a nursing license or a postsecondary education teacher might need a teaching license.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Advancement</strong></h3>\n\n<p>A major goal for postsecondary teachers with a doctoral degree is attaining a tenure—a guarantee that a professor cannot be fired without just cause. It can take up to 7 years of moving up the ranks in tenure-track positions. The ranks are assistant professor, associate professor, and professor. Tenure is granted through a review of the candidate’s research, contribution to the institution, and teaching.</p>\n\n<p>Tenure and tenure track positions are declining as institutions are relying more heavily on part-time faculty.</p>\n\n<p>Some tenured professors advance to administrative positions, such as dean or president.

A formal educational credential is typically not needed for craft artists. However, it is difficult to gain adequate artistic skills without some formal education. High school classes such as art, shop, and home economics can teach prospective craft artists some of the basic skills they will need, such as drawing, woodworking, and sewing.</p>\n\n<p>A large number of colleges and universities offer bachelor\'s and master’s degrees in fine arts. In addition to offering studio art and art history, postsecondary programs may include core subjects, such as English, marketing, social science, and natural science. Independent schools of art and design also offer postsecondary education programs, which can lead to a certificate in an art-related specialty or to an associate’s, bachelor’s, or master’s degree in fine arts.</p>\n\n<p>In 2014, the <a href=\"http://nasad.arts-accredit.org/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">National Association of Schools of Art and Design</a> (NASAD) accredited approximately 320 postsecondary institutions with programs in art and design. Most of these schools award a degree in art.</p>\n\n<p>Medical illustrators must have a demonstrated artistic ability and a detailed knowledge of human and animal anatomy, living organisms, and surgical and medical procedures. They usually need a bachelor’s degree that combining combines art and premedical courses. Medical illustrators may choose to get a master’s degree in medical illustration. Three accredited schools offer this degree in the United States.</p>\n\n<p>Education gives artists an opportunity to develop their portfolio, which is a collection of an artist’s work that demonstrates his or her styles and abilities. Portfolios are essential, because art directors, clients, and others look at them in deciding whether to hire an artist or to buy the artist’s work. In addition to compiling a physical portfolio, many artists choose to create a portfolio online so that potential buyers and clients can view their work on the Internet.</p>\n\n<p>Bachelor’s or higher degrees in fine arts or arts administration are usually necessary for management or administrative positions in government, management positions in private foundations, and teaching positions in colleges and universities.

Others attend noncredit classes or workshops or take private lessons, which may be offered in artists’ studios or at community colleges, art centers, galleries, museums, or other art-related institutions.</p>\n\n<p>Still other artists work closely with other artists or assist them on either a formal or an informal basis. Formal arrangements may include internships or apprenticeship programs. Artists hired by firms often start with relatively routine work. While doing this work, they may observe other artists and practice their own skills.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Important Qualities</strong></h3>\n\n<p><strong><em>Artistic ability.</em></strong> Craft and fine artists create artwork and other objects that are visually appealing or thought provoking. This endeavor usually requires significant skill and attention to detail in one or more art forms.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Business skills.</em></strong> Craft and fine artists must promote themselves and their art to build a reputation and to sell their art. They often study the market for their crafts or artwork to increase their understanding of what potential customers might want.

In 2014, there were more than 200 occupational therapy assistant programs accredited by the Accreditation Council for Occupational Therapy Education, a branch of the <a href=\"http://www.aota.org/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">American Occupational Therapy Association</a>.</p>\n\n<p>These programs generally require 2 years of full-time study and include instruction in subjects such as psychology, biology, and pediatric health. In addition to taking coursework, occupational therapy assistants must complete at least 16 weeks of fieldwork to gain hands-on work experience.</p>\n\n<p>People interested in becoming an occupational therapy assistant should take high school courses in biology and health education. They also can increase their chances of getting into a community college or technical school program by doing volunteer work in a healthcare setting, such as a nursing care facility, an occupational therapist’s office, or a physical therapist’s office.</p>\n\n<p>Occupational therapy aides typically have a high school diploma or equivalent. They are trained on the job under the supervision of more experienced assistants or aides. Training can last from several days to a few weeks and covers a number of topics, including the setting up of therapy equipment and infection control procedures, among others. Previous work experience in healthcare, as well as certifications in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and basic life support (BLS), may be helpful in getting a job.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Important Qualities</strong></h3>\n\n<p><strong><em>Compassion.</em></strong> Occupational therapy assistants and aides frequently work with patients who struggle with many of life’s basic activities. As a result, they should be compassionate and have the ability to encourage others.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Detail oriented.</em></strong> Occupational therapy assistants and aides must be able to quickly and accurately follow the instructions, both written and spoken, of an occupational therapist. In addition, aides must pay attention to detail when performing clerical tasks, such as helping a patient fill out an insurance form. <strong><em>&#160;</em></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Flexibility.</em></strong> Assistants must be flexible when treating patients. Because not every type of therapy will work for each patient, assistants may need to be creative when working with occupational therapists to determine the best type of therapy to use for achieving a patient’s goals.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Interpersonal skills.</em></strong> Occupational therapy assistants and aides spend much of their time interacting with patients and therefore should be friendly and courteous. They also should be able to communicate clearly with patients and with patients’ families to the extent of their training.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Physical strength.</em></strong> Assistants and aides need to have a moderate degree of strength because of the physical exertion required to assist patients. Constant kneeling, stooping, and standing for long periods also are part of the job.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Licenses, Certifications, and Registrations</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Nearly all states require occupational therapy assistants to be licensed or registered. Licensure typically requires the completion of an accredited occupational therapy assistant education program, completion of all fieldwork requirements, and passing the <a href=\"http://www.nbcot.org/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">National Board for Certification in Occupational Therapy</a> (NBCOT) exam. Some states have additional requirements.</p>\n\n<p>Occupational therapy assistants must pass the NBCOT exam to use the title “Certified Occupational Therapy Assistant” (COTA). They must also take continuing education classes to maintain their certification.</p>\n\n<p>The American Occupational Therapy Association also offers a number of specialty certifications for occupational therapy assistants who want to demonstrate their specialized level of knowledge, skills, and abilities in specialized areas of practice such as low vision or feeding, eating and swallowing.</p>\n\n<p>Occupational therapy aides are not regulated.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Advancement</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Some occupational therapy assistants and aides advance by gaining additional education and becoming <a href=\"/ooh/healthcare/occupational-therapists.htm\"><u>occupational therapists</u></a>. A small number of occupational therapist “bridge” education programs are designed to qualify occupational therapy assistants to advance and become therapists.</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"], "25-1064": ["Title": "Postsecondary Teachers", "Description": "Postsecondary teachers instruct students in a wide variety of academic and career and technical subjects beyond the high school level.

Federal and state laws and court decisions affect how claims must be handled and what insurance policies can and must cover. Examiners working on life and health claims must stay up to date on new medical procedures and the latest prescription drugs. Examiners working on auto claims must be familiar with new car models and the most recent repair techniques. In order to fulfill their continuing education requirements, workers can attend classes or workshops, write articles for claims publications, or give lectures and presentations.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Important Qualities</strong></h3>\n\n<p><strong><em>Analytical skills.</em></strong> Adjusters and examiners must both evaluate whether the insurance company is obligated to pay a claim and determine the amount to pay. Adjusters must carefully consider various pieces of information to reach a decision.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Communication skills.</em></strong> Claims adjusters and investigators must get information from a wide range of people, including claimants, witnesses, and medical experts. They must know the right questions to ask in order to gather the information they need.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Detail oriented. </em></strong>Adjusters, appraisers, examiners, and investigators must carefully review documents and damaged property, because small details can have large financial consequences.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Interpersonal skills.</em></strong> Adjusters, examiners, and investigators often meet with claimants and others who may be upset by the situation that requires a claim or by the settlement the company is offering.

All pilots who are paid to fly must have at least a commercial pilot’s license from the <a href=\"http://www.faa.gov/\" class=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)</a>. In addition, airline pilots must have the Airline Transport Pilot (ATP) certificate. The ATP certificate, and instrument and multiengine ratings expand the privileges granted by the commercial pilot’s license and may be required by certain employers.</p>\n\n<p>Most pilots begin their flight training with independent instructors or through flight schools. Fixed base operators (FBO) usually provide a wide range of general aviation services, such as aircraft fueling, maintenance, and on-demand air transportation services, and they may also offer flight training. An FBO may manage a flight school or call its training department a school. Some flight schools are parts of 2- and 4-year colleges and universities.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Education and Training</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Airline pilots typically need a bachelor’s degree in any subject, along with a commercial pilot’s license and an ATP certificate from the FAA. Airline pilots typically start their careers in flying as commercial pilots. Pilots usually accrue thousands of hours of flight experience to get a job with regional or major airlines.</p>\n\n<p>The military traditionally has been an important source of experienced pilots because of the extensive training it provides. However, increased duty requirements have reduced the incentives for these pilots to transfer out of military aviation and into civilian aviation. Most military pilots who transfer to civilian aviation are able to transfer directly into the airlines rather than working in commercial aviation.</p>\n\n<p>Commercial pilots must have a commercial pilot’s license and typically need a high school diploma or the equivalent. Some employers have additional requirements. For example, agricultural pilots need to have an understanding of common agricultural practices, fertilizers, fungicides, herbicides, and pesticides. Flight instructors have to have special FAA-issued certificates and ratings, such as Certified Flight Instructor (CFI), CFI-Instrument (CFII), Multi-Engine Instructor (MEI), MEI-Instrument (MEII), and possibly others. Many additional requirements exist for other specialties. They range from being able to operate gliders and tow banners to being qualified to fly helicopters and airships.</p>\n\n<p>Commercial pilots typically begin their flight training with independent FAA-certified flight instructors or at schools that offer flight training. The FAA certifies hundreds of civilian flight schools, which range from small FBOs to large state universities. Some colleges and universities offer pilot training as part of a 2- or 4-year aviation degree. Regardless of whether pilots attend flight schools or learn from independent instructors, all pilots need the FAA’s commercial pilot license before they can be paid to fly. In addition, most commercial pilots need an instrument rating, typically to fly through clouds or other conditions that limit visibility. An instrument rating also is required to carry paying passengers more than 50 miles from the point of origin of their flight or at night.</p>\n\n<p>Interviews for positions with major and regional airlines often reflect the FAA exams for pilot licenses, certificates, and instrument ratings, and can be intense. Airlines frequently will conduct their own psychological and aptitude tests in order to make sure that their pilots are of good moral character and can make good decisions under pressure.</p>\n\n<p>Airline and commercial pilots who are newly hired by airlines or on-demand air services companies must undergo moderate-term on-the-job training in accordance with Federal Aviation Regulations (FARs). This training usually includes 6–8 weeks of ground school and 25 hours of flight time. In addition, commercial pilots may need specific training based on the type of flying they are doing. For example, those who tow banners will likely need at least 200 hours in airplanes with conventional (tailwheel) landing gear. Further, various types of ratings for specific aircraft, such as the Boeing 737 or Cessna Citation, typically are acquired through employer-based training and generally are earned by pilots who have at least a commercial license.</p>\n\n<p>Besides initial training and licensing requirements, all pilots must maintain their experience in performing certain maneuvers. This requirement means that pilots must perform specific maneuvers and procedures a given number of times within a specified amount of time. Furthermore, pilots must undergo periodic training and medical examinations, generally every year or every other year.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Work Experience in a Related Occupation</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Airline pilots typically begin their careers as commercial pilots. Pilots usually accrue thousands of hours of flight experience as commercial pilots or in the military to get a job with regional or major airlines.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Licenses, Certifications, and Registrations</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Those who are seeking a career as a professional pilot typically get their licenses and ratings in the following order:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Student Pilot Certificate</li>\n\n<li>Private Pilot License</li>\n\n<li>Instrument Rating</li>\n\n<li>Commercial Pilot License</li>\n\n<li>Multi-Engine Rating</li>\n\n<li>Airline Transport Pilot Certificate</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Each certificate and rating requires that pilots pass a written exam on the ground and a practical flying exam, usually called a check ride, in an appropriate aircraft. In addition to earning these licenses, many pilots get Certified Flight Instructor (CFI) rating after they get their commercial certificate. The CFI rating helps them build flight time and experience more quickly and at less personal expense. Current licensing regulations can be found in FARs.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Commercial pilot license.</em></strong> To qualify for a commercial pilot license, applicants must be at least 18 years old and meet certain flight-hour requirements. When student pilots first begin their training, they need to get a logbook and keep detailed records of their flight time. Also, their school may require them to log their ground instruction time. The logbook must be endorsed by the flight instructor in order for the student to be able to take the FAA knowledge and practical exams. For specific requirements, including details on the types and quantities of flight experience and knowledge requirements, see the FARs. Part 61 of Title 14 of the code of federal regulations (<a href=\"http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp&amp;r=PART&amp;n=14y2.0.1.1.2\" class=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">14 CFR part 61</a>) covers the basic rules for the certification of pilots. Flight schools can train pilots in accordance with the rules from part 61 or the rules found in <a href=\"http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title40/40cfr141_main_02.tpl\" class=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">14 CFR part 141</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, applicants must pass the appropriate medical exam, meet all of the detailed flight experience and knowledge requirements, and pass a written exam and a practical flight exam in order to become commercially licensed. The physical exam confirms that the pilot’s vision is correctable to 20/20 and that no physical handicaps exist that could impair the pilot’s performance.</p>\n\n<p>Commercial pilots must hold an instrument rating if they want to carry passengers for pay more than 50 miles from the point of origin of their flight or at night.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Instrument rating.</em></strong> Earning their instrument rating enables pilots to fly during periods of low visibility, also known as instrument meteorological conditions or IMC. They may qualify for this rating by having at least 40 hours of instrument flight experience and 50 hours of cross-country flight time as pilot in command and by meeting other requirements detailed in the FARs.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Airline transport pilot (ATP) certification.</em></strong> Beginning in 2013, all pilot crews of a scheduled commercial airliner must have ATP certificates. To earn the ATP certificate, applicants must be at least 23 years old, have a minimum of 1,500 hours of flight time, and pass written and practical flight exams. Furthermore, airline pilots usually maintain one or more aircraft-type ratings, which allow them to fly aircraft that require specific training, depending on the requirements of their particular airline. Some exceptions and alternative requirements are detailed in the FARs.</p>\n\n<p>Pilots must pass periodic physical and practical flight examinations to be able to perform the duties granted by their certificate.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Other Experience</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Minimum time requirements to get a certificate or rating may not be enough to get some jobs. To make up the gap between paying for training and flying for the major airlines, many commercial pilots begin their careers as flight instructors and on-demand charter pilots. These positions typically require less experience than airline jobs require. When pilots have built enough flying hours, they can apply to the airlines. Newly hired pilots at regional airlines typically have about 2,000 hours of flight experience. Newly hired pilots at major airlines typically have about 4,000 hours of flight experience. Many commercial piloting jobs have minimum requirements of around 500 hours. Numerous factors can affect this number, such as the type of flight time the pilot has.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Important Qualities</strong></h3>\n\n<p><strong><em>Communication skills.</em></strong> Pilots must speak clearly when conveying information to air traffic controllers and other crew members. They must also listen carefully for instructions.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Observational skills.</em></strong> Pilots must regularly watch over screens, gauges, and dials to make sure that all systems are in working order. They also need to maintain situational awareness by looking for other aircraft or obstacles. Pilots must be able to see clearly, be able to judge the distance between objects, and possess good color vision.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Problem-solving skills.</em></strong> Pilots must be able to identify complex problems and figure out appropriate solutions. When a plane encounters turbulence, for example, pilots may assess the weather conditions and request a change in route or altitude from air traffic control.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Quick reaction time.</em></strong> Pilots must be able to respond quickly, and with good judgment, to any impending danger, because warning signals can appear with no notice.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Advancement</strong></h3>\n\n<p>For airline pilots, advancement depends on a system of seniority outlined in collective bargaining contracts. Typically, after 1 to 5 years, flight engineers may advance to first officer positions and, after 5 to 15 years, first officers can become captains. In large companies, a captain could become a chief pilot or a director of aviation.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"], "17-3012": ["Title": "Drafters", "Description": "Drafters use software to convert the designs of engineers and architects into technical drawings.

Some states allow lawyers to take their continuing education credits through online courses.&#160;</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Advancement</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Newly hired attorneys usually start as associates and work with more experienced lawyers. After several years, some lawyers may be admitted to partnership of their firm, which means they become partial owners of the firm.</p>\n\n<p>After gaining a few years of work experience, some lawyers go into practice for themselves or move to the legal department of a large corporation. Very few in-house attorneys are hired directly out of law school.</p>\n\n<p>A small number of experienced lawyers are nominated or elected to judgeships. Other lawyers may become full-time law school faculty and administrators. For more information about judges and law school faculty, see the profile on <a href=\"/ooh/legal/judges-and-hearing-officers.htm\"><u>judges and hearing officers</u></a> and the profile on <a href=\"/ooh/education-training-and-library/postsecondary-teachers.htm\"><u>postsecondary teachers</u></a>.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Other Experience</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Law students often gain practical experience by participating in school-sponsored legal clinics, in a school’s moot court competitions, in practice trials under the supervision of experienced lawyers and judges, and through research and writing on legal issues for a school’s law journals.</p>\n\n<p>Part-time jobs or summer internships in law firms, government agencies, and corporate legal departments also provide valuable experience. Some smaller firms, government agencies, and public interest organizations may hire students as summer associate interns after they have completed their first year at law school. Many larger firms’ summer internship programs are only eligible to law students who have completed their second year. These experiences can help law students decide what kind of legal work they want to focus on in their careers, and these internships may lead directly to a job after graduation.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Important Qualities</strong></h3>\n\n<p><strong><em>Analytical skills</em>.</strong> Lawyers help their clients resolve problems and issues. As a result, they must be able to analyze large amounts of information, determine relevant facts, and propose viable solutions.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Interpersonal skills.</em></strong> Lawyers must win the respect and confidence of their clients by building a trusting relationship, so that clients feel comfortable enough to share personal information related to their case.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Problem-solving skills.</em></strong> Lawyers must separate their emotions and prejudice from their clients’ problems and objectively evaluate the matter. Therefore, good problem-solving skills are important for lawyers, to prepare the best defense and recommendation.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Research skills.</em></strong> Preparing legal advice or representation for a client commonly requires substantial research. All lawyers need to be able to find what applicable laws and regulations apply to a specific matter.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Speaking skills.</em></strong> Clients hire lawyers to speak on their behalf. Lawyers must be able to clearly present and explain their case to arbitrators, mediators, opposing parties, judges, or juries.&#160;</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Writing skills.</em></strong> Lawyers need to be precise and specific when preparing documents, such as wills, trusts, and powers of attorney.</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"], "35-2019": ["Title": "Cooks", "Description": "Cooks prepare, season, and cook a wide range of foods, which may include soups, salads, entrees, and desserts.", "How to Become One": "\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n<p>Most cooks learn their skills through on-the-job training and work-related experience.

An FBO may manage a flight school or call its training department a school. Some flight schools are parts of 2- and 4-year colleges and universities.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Education and Training</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Airline pilots typically need a bachelor’s degree in any subject, along with a commercial pilot’s license and an ATP certificate from the FAA. Airline pilots typically start their careers in flying as commercial pilots. Pilots usually accrue thousands of hours of flight experience to get a job with regional or major airlines.</p>\n\n<p>The military traditionally has been an important source of experienced pilots because of the extensive training it provides. However, increased duty requirements have reduced the incentives for these pilots to transfer out of military aviation and into civilian aviation. Most military pilots who transfer to civilian aviation are able to transfer directly into the airlines rather than working in commercial aviation.</p>\n\n<p>Commercial pilots must have a commercial pilot’s license and typically need a high school diploma or the equivalent. Some employers have additional requirements. For example, agricultural pilots need to have an understanding of common agricultural practices, fertilizers, fungicides, herbicides, and pesticides. Flight instructors have to have special FAA-issued certificates and ratings, such as Certified Flight Instructor (CFI), CFI-Instrument (CFII), Multi-Engine Instructor (MEI), MEI-Instrument (MEII), and possibly others. Many additional requirements exist for other specialties. They range from being able to operate gliders and tow banners to being qualified to fly helicopters and airships.</p>\n\n<p>Commercial pilots typically begin their flight training with independent FAA-certified flight instructors or at schools that offer flight training. The FAA certifies hundreds of civilian flight schools, which range from small FBOs to large state universities. Some colleges and universities offer pilot training as part of a 2- or 4-year aviation degree. Regardless of whether pilots attend flight schools or learn from independent instructors, all pilots need the FAA’s commercial pilot license before they can be paid to fly. In addition, most commercial pilots need an instrument rating, typically to fly through clouds or other conditions that limit visibility. An instrument rating also is required to carry paying passengers more than 50 miles from the point of origin of their flight or at night.</p>\n\n<p>Interviews for positions with major and regional airlines often reflect the FAA exams for pilot licenses, certificates, and instrument ratings, and can be intense. Airlines frequently will conduct their own psychological and aptitude tests in order to make sure that their pilots are of good moral character and can make good decisions under pressure.</p>\n\n<p>Airline and commercial pilots who are newly hired by airlines or on-demand air services companies must undergo moderate-term on-the-job training in accordance with Federal Aviation Regulations (FARs). This training usually includes 6–8 weeks of ground school and 25 hours of flight time. In addition, commercial pilots may need specific training based on the type of flying they are doing. For example, those who tow banners will likely need at least 200 hours in airplanes with conventional (tailwheel) landing gear. Further, various types of ratings for specific aircraft, such as the Boeing 737 or Cessna Citation, typically are acquired through employer-based training and generally are earned by pilots who have at least a commercial license.</p>\n\n<p>Besides initial training and licensing requirements, all pilots must maintain their experience in performing certain maneuvers. This requirement means that pilots must perform specific maneuvers and procedures a given number of times within a specified amount of time. Furthermore, pilots must undergo periodic training and medical examinations, generally every year or every other year.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Work Experience in a Related Occupation</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Airline pilots typically begin their careers as commercial pilots. Pilots usually accrue thousands of hours of flight experience as commercial pilots or in the military to get a job with regional or major airlines.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Licenses, Certifications, and Registrations</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Those who are seeking a career as a professional pilot typically get their licenses and ratings in the following order:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Student Pilot Certificate</li>\n\n<li>Private Pilot License</li>\n\n<li>Instrument Rating</li>\n\n<li>Commercial Pilot License</li>\n\n<li>Multi-Engine Rating</li>\n\n<li>Airline Transport Pilot Certificate</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Each certificate and rating requires that pilots pass a written exam on the ground and a practical flying exam, usually called a check ride, in an appropriate aircraft. In addition to earning these licenses, many pilots get Certified Flight Instructor (CFI) rating after they get their commercial certificate. The CFI rating helps them build flight time and experience more quickly and at less personal expense. Current licensing regulations can be found in FARs.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Commercial pilot license.</em></strong> To qualify for a commercial pilot license, applicants must be at least 18 years old and meet certain flight-hour requirements. When student pilots first begin their training, they need to get a logbook and keep detailed records of their flight time. Also, their school may require them to log their ground instruction time. The logbook must be endorsed by the flight instructor in order for the student to be able to take the FAA knowledge and practical exams. For specific requirements, including details on the types and quantities of flight experience and knowledge requirements, see the FARs.

The physical exam confirms that the pilot’s vision is correctable to 20/20 and that no physical handicaps exist that could impair the pilot’s performance.</p>\n\n<p>Commercial pilots must hold an instrument rating if they want to carry passengers for pay more than 50 miles from the point of origin of their flight or at night.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Instrument rating.</em></strong> Earning their instrument rating enables pilots to fly during periods of low visibility, also known as instrument meteorological conditions or IMC. They may qualify for this rating by having at least 40 hours of instrument flight experience and 50 hours of cross-country flight time as pilot in command and by meeting other requirements detailed in the FARs.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Airline transport pilot (ATP) certification.</em></strong> Beginning in 2013, all pilot crews of a scheduled commercial airliner must have ATP certificates. To earn the ATP certificate, applicants must be at least 23 years old, have a minimum of 1,500 hours of flight time, and pass written and practical flight exams. Furthermore, airline pilots usually maintain one or more aircraft-type ratings, which allow them to fly aircraft that require specific training, depending on the requirements of their particular airline. Some exceptions and alternative requirements are detailed in the FARs.</p>\n\n<p>Pilots must pass periodic physical and practical flight examinations to be able to perform the duties granted by their certificate.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Other Experience</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Minimum time requirements to get a certificate or rating may not be enough to get some jobs. To make up the gap between paying for training and flying for the major airlines, many commercial pilots begin their careers as flight instructors and on-demand charter pilots. These positions typically require less experience than airline jobs require. When pilots have built enough flying hours, they can apply to the airlines. Newly hired pilots at regional airlines typically have about 2,000 hours of flight experience. Newly hired pilots at major airlines typically have about 4,000 hours of flight experience. Many commercial piloting jobs have minimum requirements of around 500 hours. Numerous factors can affect this number, such as the type of flight time the pilot has.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Important Qualities</strong></h3>\n\n<p><strong><em>Communication skills.</em></strong> Pilots must speak clearly when conveying information to air traffic controllers and other crew members. They must also listen carefully for instructions.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Observational skills.</em></strong> Pilots must regularly watch over screens, gauges, and dials to make sure that all systems are in working order. They also need to maintain situational awareness by looking for other aircraft or obstacles. Pilots must be able to see clearly, be able to judge the distance between objects, and possess good color vision.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Problem-solving skills.</em></strong> Pilots must be able to identify complex problems and figure out appropriate solutions. When a plane encounters turbulence, for example, pilots may assess the weather conditions and request a change in route or altitude from air traffic control.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Quick reaction time.</em></strong> Pilots must be able to respond quickly, and with good judgment, to any impending danger, because warning signals can appear with no notice.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Advancement</strong></h3>\n\n<p>For airline pilots, advancement depends on a system of seniority outlined in collective bargaining contracts. Typically, after 1 to 5 years, flight engineers may advance to first officer positions and, after 5 to 15 years, first officers can become captains. In large companies, a captain could become a chief pilot or a director of aviation.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"], "21-1013": ["Title": "Mental Health Counselors and Marriage and Family Therapists", "Description": "Mental health counselors and marriage and family therapists help people manage and overcome mental and emotional disorders and problems with family and other relationships.

Other coursework includes mathematics, physics, and chemistry.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Training</strong></h3>\n\n<p>In nuclear power plants, nuclear technicians start out as trainees under the supervision of more experienced technicians. During their training, they are taught the proper ways to use operating and monitoring equipment. They are also taught safety procedures, regulations, and plant policies. Workers who do not have the appropriate associate’s degree or its equivalent usually have a substantial period of onsite technical training provided by their employer before they begin full duties and a normal training schedule.</p>\n\n<p>Training varies with the technician’s previous experience and education. Most training programs last between 6 months and 2 years. Nuclear technicians go through additional training and education throughout their careers to keep up with advances in nuclear science and technology.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Licenses, Certifications, and Registrations</strong></h3>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.nei.org/Careers-Education/Education-Resources/Nuclear-Energy-Training-Education-Programs/Nuclear-Uniform-Curriculum-Program\" class=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Nuclear Energy Institute</a> offers a certificate through its Nuclear Uniform Curriculum Program.

At a minimum they must hold the degree of the program in which they are teaching. For example, the teacher must hold an associate’s degree if they teach a program that is at the associate’s degree level. In addition, work experience or certification may be just as important as education for getting a postsecondary teaching job at a career or technical school.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Other Experience</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Some institutions may prefer to hire those with teaching or other work experience, but this is not a requirement for all fields or for all employers.</p>\n\n<p>In health specialties, art, or education fields, hands-on work experience in the industry can be important. Postsecondary teachers in these fields often gain experience by working in an occupation related to their field of expertise.</p>\n\n<p>In fields such as biological science, physics, and chemistry, some postsecondary teachers have postdoctoral research experience. These short-term jobs, sometimes called “post-docs,” usually involve working for 2 to 3 years as a research associate or in a similar position, often at a college or university.</p>\n\n<p>Some postsecondary teachers gain teaching experience by working as graduate teaching assistants—students who are enrolled in a graduate program and teach classes in the institution in which they are enrolled.</p>\n\n<p>Some postsecondary teachers, especially adjunct professors, have another job in addition to teaching.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Licenses, Certifications, and Registrations</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Postsecondary teachers who prepare students for an occupation that requires a license, certification, or registration, may need to have—or they may benefit from having—the same credential. For example, a postsecondary nursing teacher might need a nursing license or a postsecondary education teacher might need a teaching license.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Advancement</strong></h3>\n\n<p>A major goal for postsecondary teachers with a doctoral degree is attaining a tenure—a guarantee that a professor cannot be fired without just cause. It can take up to 7 years of moving up the ranks in tenure-track positions. The ranks are assistant professor, associate professor, and professor. Tenure is granted through a review of the candidate’s research, contribution to the institution, and teaching.</p>\n\n<p>Tenure and tenure track positions are declining as institutions are relying more heavily on part-time faculty.</p>\n\n<p>Some tenured professors advance to administrative positions, such as dean or president.
